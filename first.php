        <h1>What is COVID-19 ?</h1>
        <p>
          Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by a
          newly discovered coronavirus. Most people infected with the COVID-19
          virus will experience mild to moderate respiratory illness and recover
          without requiring special treatment. Older people, and those with
          underlying medical problems like cardiovascular disease, diabetes,
          chronic respiratory disease, and cancer are more likely to develop
          serious illness. The best way to prevent and slow down transmission is
          be well informed about the COVID-19 virus, the disease it causes and
          how it spreads. Protect yourself and others from infection by washing
          your hands or using an alcohol based rub frequently and not touching
          your face.
